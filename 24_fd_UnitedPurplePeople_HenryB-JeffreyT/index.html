                        Mathias was a creature living in the Great Green Forest. One day, he was blind and awoke within a strange box of sorts
                        Within the box, Mathias was surrounded by other fluffy friends. Some who were bigger than him and some who were smaller.
                        <br><br>After a while, Mathias was finally freed from the darkness within the box. One by one, Mathias and his fluffy friends were 
                        picked up by person's hand. They were each placed on cold shelves on which they spent the night. When morning came, the place 
                        was surrounded by drunk adults and loud children. 
                        <br><br>In the same Dave & Buster's, Jeffery and his little brother Matthew were playing games for points. Luckily, Matthew pulled 
                        down on the handle to spin a wheel and won the jackpot, scoring them 1000 points! After spending all their credits, the brothers 
                        walked into the rewards shop. Having looked around for a while, Matthew picked up Mathias and brought him to the counter.
                        <br><br>Mathias soon became best friends with Jeffery and Matthew and followed them whenever they went. Mathias came to school on 
                        the Ducky Meet and Greet and met Henry and e, who he quickly became friends with as they assisted in Jeffery and Henry's coding 
                        sessions

                        I must admit that much of e's story current is beyond me though I am always curious to learn of what preceded their life with me. With that in mind, our story begins in the dark depths of a LARGE lake far north of here. At the bottom of the lake lied an old relic, a cement cyclinder with a large metal rusted ring on top. One day, the world aligned in such a way that around this cement block my path met with e's. After diving into the depths, e was discovered around one half of the rusted away ring that emerged from the cement block. Questiosn filled my mind- how could such a magnificent ducky end up in such a place? Was it the power of the water that drew me to e? Was it the actions of an individual I've yet to meet?
