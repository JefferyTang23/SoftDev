                        Mathias was a creature living in the Great Green Forest. One day, he was blind and awoke within a strange box of sorts
                        Within the box, Mathias was surrounded by other fluffy friends. Some who were bigger than him and some who were smaller.
                        After a while, Mathias was finally freed from the darkness within the box. One by one, Mathias and his fluffy friends were 
                        picked up by person's hand. They were each placed on cold shelves on which they spent the night. When morning came, the place 
                        was surrounded by drunk adults and loud children. 
                        <br><br>Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year. In early 2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008–09 season by helping FC Barcelona capture the club’s first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season): the team won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. He scored 38 goals in 51 matches during that season, and he bested Ronaldo in the balloting for FIFA World Player of the Year honours by a record margin. During the 2009–10 season Messi scored 34 goals in domestic games as Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. He earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, and he was named the 2010 world player of the year (the award was renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or that year).\

                        I must admit that much of e's story current is beyond me though I am always curious to learn of what preceded their life with me. With that in mind, our story begins in the dark depths of a LARGE lake far north of here. At the bottom of the lake lied an old relic, a cement cyclinder with a large metal rusted ring on top. One day, the world aligned in such a way that around this cement block my path met with e's. After diving into the depths, e was discovered around one half of the rusted away ring that emerged from the cement block. Questiosn filled my mind- how could such a magnificent ducky end up in such a place? Was it the power of the water that drew me to e? Was it the actions of an individual I've yet to meet?
