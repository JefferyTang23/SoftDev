## Notes
- Well, I feel like we're going to forget all the names for these classes and options, but at least we can copy them from here

## QCC
- Is Foundation easier? :) (Please)
- Btw, Foundation is also the name of Henry's favorite book series and uh, I kind of react like someone is saying my name when someone says Foundation so I hope thats not a problem.
- What is the meaning of life?
- Why do the bootstrap examples still look the right way even when we remove like what seems to be too much code? Is HTML just like really resilient?
